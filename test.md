**Skill:** NinJutsu<br>
**Effect:** The Sharingan is a special eye that grants the user a broad form of abilities, and unlocks techniques dedicated to the Sharingan.<br>
**Special:** Handseals<br>
**Drawback:** ---<br>
**Description:** Picture The Sharingan is the most feared ability of the Uchiha Clan. This unique ability manifests in a clan member's eyes, and while some might call it a genetic aberration of deformity, the Uchiha have used this gift to devastating effect. In some members this ability will only let them anticipate or predict the path of an attack. The user activates this ability as a "C" Rank weaving movement that does not provoke an opportunity of attack. Each Rank learned the user gains a Tomoe (maximum 3). User gains a +10 insight bonus to Investigate, Observation, Reading Lips, and Forgery (to copy writers) checks per Tomoe. User gains a +10 insight bonus to Sense Motive against Feints per Tomoe.

See Chakra<br>
<br>
See Chakra: User can see chakra being used, chakra auras and lingering chakra. It allows the user to attempt to identify the effect of lingering chakra (use Chakra Lore Skills).<br>
<br>
User can make an Observation skill check to detect GenJutsu techniques or see Chakra Activity. User can focus their sight to examine a creature or object to detect traces of lingering chakra with an Observation check. Traces are the result of an active effect placed on the target from a technique or ability needing Chakra. Success allows the user to make a second check to identify the effect to get a rough idea of the source, but requires a clear line of sight to the target. Check difficulty depends on the Source Strength.<br>
<br>
"D" and "C" Rank/Class, Faint strength, Very Difficult Difficulty.<br>
"B" Rank/Class, Moderate strength, Difficult Difficulty.<br>
"A" Rank/Class, Strong strength, Average Difficulty.<br>
"S" Rank/Class, Overwhelming strength, Easy Difficulty.<br>
<br>
A User can see a creature's Class Level and can determine the strength of the chakra signature, but does not gain a bonus to Observation checks to detect a creature regardless of the strength of its chakra aura.

**Drawback:** ---<br>
**Description:** A Sharingan based technique. A user can focus their stare on 1 creature within 7 meters + 6 meters per Class Level as a weaving movement. That creature takes a -2 penalty on Will Saves. This penalty changes to -3 at "C" Class. A user can maintain their stare against only 1 opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the user stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than the range, or the user falls unconscious or dies. The user can remove the memory of their stare from the target's mind; the creature does not remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the user allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the Uchiha's focus than the target's Observation of their stare. It cannot be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The Uchiha can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a Verify Difficult Observation check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the Uchiha's focus, so if they use their gaze attack or similar ability, user must target the subject of their hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple Uchihas' stares do not stack. This is a mind-affecting effect.<br>
**Limit:** Must be an Uchiha. Must know Sharingan.<br>

A user can maintain this stare on one ally at one time; it remains in effect until the user stares at a new ally, the ally dies, the ally moves further than Hypnotic Stare distance, or the user falls unconscious or dies. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the Uchiha's focus than the target's Observation of their stare. It cannot be avoided in the same way a gaze attack can. The Uchiha can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a Verify Difficult Observation check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the user's focus, so if the user uses a gaze attack or similar ability, the user must voluntarily end the stare.<br>
**Limit:** Must be an Uchiha. Must know Hypnotic Stare.<br>
