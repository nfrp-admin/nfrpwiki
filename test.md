# Supplementary Skills

    Four Becomes Three
    Rank: D
    Skill: Supplementary
    Effect: Allows the bard to slip away unseen.
    Special: --
    Drawback: Must be used in a group of four or more.
    Description: One of the skills of the bard is knowing when they are no longer needed or when to bow out. Thus in groups of four or more, the bard included, the bard can use their knowledge and skill to slip away from the group unseen. This will not work if someone is paying direct attention to the bard at that time.
    Limit: Art of the Bard.
